# Project for my Computer Vision Class

This project was built for my computer vision class, a model developed using Tensorflow and the Fer2013 dataset, as a csv file. This model can reach accuracies of 65%, which approaches the state-of-the-art current model which has reached a 73% using traditional methods. This model was built by pre-training a model from scratch, rather than using a fine-tuned model, which had lend us some freedom with model input and architecture.
